## Introduction

TungTung is an app designed to make managing shared expenses **easier and hassle-free**.

Whether you’re sharing costs for a group meal, buying a gift together, or splitting transportation fees, TungTung helps you track everyone’s contributions, keep things organized, and share detailed updates with just a few taps.

The app uses **SwiftUI** and **SwiftData** to provide a smooth, native experience with automatic expense calculations and easy communication between participants.

The challenges we've experienced while building TungTung:
1. **Developing a Seamless User Experience**:
   The main challenge was to create an intuitive flow that allows users to easily add expenses, track payments, and share details without confusion. We worked hard to make the interface clear and simple.

2. **Payment Management**:
   Allowing users to input their bank details securely and associate payments with specific users was another challenge, ensuring users can track payments without error.

3. **Research and Refining Features**:
   We constantly worked on refining the features based on user feedback, ensuring TungTung is the most practical solution for managing group expenses.
